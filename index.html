     <p>In the current age my generation is growing up in, we have a lot of access 
    to smartphones and tablets. I wondered if this affected grades. I chose 
    this problem because if technology causes a negative effect, it can harm 
    kids, and I care about that. However, if technology causes a positive effect, 
    I want kids to be able to have access to that technology. </p>

     <p>My project falls under the category of social sciences. I used survey data to

	 <p>A woman named Delaney Ruston created a movie called 
	 <a href="https://www.screenagersmovie.com">Screenagers</a>, a documentary about cell phones, and how they are 
	 changing our world today. She had also noticed that a lot more 
	 schools now days are letting students keep their phones with them 
	 during the school day, which could be leading to kids not paying 
	 attention in school. A 2015 study in the UK found that test scores 
	 improved by 6.41% when the schools prohibited cell phones during 
	 the school day. A 2017 study let part of a group of students keep 
	 their phones, had part of the group put their phones in a 
	 different room, and gave them all memory tasks to complete. The 
	 people who had their phones with them did worse on these tasks 
	 than the other group of students. She also found that having 
	 access to a phone all the time can lead to depression or anxiety. 
	 For instance teenagers can start to feel bad about themselves if 
	 they are left out of a group chat or start comparing themselves to 
	 a photo they see online. Sage journals, a publishing company, also 
	 did some research on this topic, only this time with college 
	 students. They found that most college students have their phones 
	 on them at all times, even when they’re studying. This can lead to 
	 distractions, such as taking, “little twitter breaks”,  as one 
	 student called them. They also found that very intense cell phone 
	 use could sometimes lead to smoking and drinking alcohol. However, 
	 cell phone use can have some positive effects, such as if you are 
	 using your phone to  find educational information, your grade 
	 could actually improve. The company Science Direct realized that 
	 cell phones are always there, and they can connect to any network 
	 at any time. Another realization they stumbled upon was that 
	 frequent cell phone use can affect the behavior and health of the 
	 user. Liebert publishing has recognized that, “More health 
	 education is needed to promote correct and effective cell phone 
	 use among adolescents.” This means that we need to control this 
	 change passing over our world, not stop it, just control it.

      <span><p>By sending out a survey, I was going to collect my data, and then I was going to turn that data into graphs and compare those graphs. 
			These are my materials: 
    </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google forms</li>
				<li>Google sheets</li>
				<li>Google docs</li>
				<li>Geany text editor</li>
  </ul></span>
  <span><p>
			These are my steps: 
			<ol>
			<li>On a google docs, I created my questions. It’s important to  spend some time on this because good questions lead to good data. </li>
			<li>I then went to google forms and created a new form by clicking the blank choice in the menu. </li>
			<li>Then I named my google form in the “untitled form” spot. </li>
			<li>Next, I wrote my first question in the “untitled question” spot.  </li>
			 <li>I then decided if I wanted my question to be multiple choice or something else from the menu, 
			 which can be accessed by clicking on the upside down triangle next to where it says multiple choice, and created my answers.</li>
			 <li>To make the next question, I pressed the little plus sign in the menu on the right side. </li>
			<li>When I was ready to send it out and publish it, I decided where I wanted to post the survey.
			  I emailed it to my teacher, and then he posted it on google classroom so the classes I needed to answer my survey could have access to it.
			   There is also a send button at the top where you can also choose from the choices they have there. </li>
			<li>When I got my results  it showed a tab next to questions that said “results”, then the number of people that have answered the survey already. 
			I clicked on the “results” tab and it showed me some pie charts that summarized all of the people’s answers, at least if you choose multiple choice that will happen, 
			and when I hovered over the different colors, it showed me the number of people that had chosen this answer. </li>
			<li>There was a white cross inside of a green box, and when I clicked on it it took me to google sheets. </li>
			<li>Once there, I saw the time of the response and the answers to the questions (that were found at the top of the sheet).  </li>
			<li>Then I found the correlation between each response in each grade. This is to find out if the answer to one question affects another. In my case, it didn’t.</li>
			<li>To make a chart I clicked on the little bar graph symbol in the menu that is next to the little comment symbol. </li>
			<li>To make the chart show the data I wanted it to, I had to change the data ranges.</li>
			<li>Once I did that, it showed me a chart editor box where I could customize my graph by choosing the type of graph that I wanted, customizing the colors, and naming the chart and axis titles. </li>
			<li>After I was finished with the chart, I exported it to where I wanted it to be. I exported my charts to a png image file so I could use them later on. </li>
			<li>I then made my website using html, Geany text editor, and CSS. In order to make my website work like a slideshow, I used the checkbox hack instead of Javascript.  </li>
			<li>Then I  uploaded my website so that I can access it without having to open any files. </li>

	<p> I sent out my survey to the 6th and 7th graders at my school, and had them fill it out. Once I got the results, 
I used them to correlate the questions, to see if one answer had any effect on another. Then I took all of my answers and made them into charts for both grades. Once all that was done, 
I found the average answers for each grade, and the average class grade from the last STAR test. This helped me determine my conclusion. 
The first thing I needed to change was the questions. I was originally going to ask everyone anonymously what their grade on the STAR test was, but that wouldn’t have worked, 
so I decided to go with the average grade for each class. I also was just going to ask them if they had a smartphone, but then I decided to also ask them if they had a tablet. 
The last thing I changed in the questions was the second part of them. I was going to ask the parents and the eighth graders some questions too, but I decided not to. 
The second thing I needed to change was the website. I wasn’t going to have that many slides, but I ended up needing a lot to fit in the information that I needed to include.

			<p>It was successful using the graphs because they helped me sort out the raw data.

		I could not come to a definite conclusion because I couldn’t get individual test scores, and the class averages for sixth and seventh grade were too similar. However, I did notice that the average seventh grade time spent on screens was higher than the sixth grade average, and the seventh grade average score on the STAR test was higher too. This suggests that my hypothesis could be wrong. Time spent on screens could actually be a benefit. If so, more schools should allow screen use. The one main thing I would have done differently was if I could’ve gotten the individual test scores instead of just the average class score so I could draw a more accurate correlation. I think this project could be created on a larger scale if I interviewed more people, not just at my school, but maybe at a public school too, to see what the difference is. I feel like my project was successful because I learned a lot, even if I didn’t reach a conclusion.
